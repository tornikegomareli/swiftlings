# Basics

Welcome to Swift! This section covers the fundamental building blocks of the Swift programming language.

## Official Swift Documentation
- [The Basics - The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/thebasics)
- [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- [String and Characters - Swift Documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/stringsandcharacters)
- [Basic Operators - Swift Documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/basicoperators)
- [Getting Started with Swift](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/)

In this section, you'll learn about:
- Variables and constants
- Basic data types
- Operators
- String manipulation

These concepts form the foundation for everything else you'll learn in Swift.

## Key Concepts

### Variables and Constants
- Use `var` to declare variables (mutable values)
- Use `let` to declare constants (immutable values)
- Swift encourages using `let` whenever possible for safer code

### Type Inference
Swift can automatically infer the type of a variable or constant based on its initial value, but you can also explicitly specify types.
